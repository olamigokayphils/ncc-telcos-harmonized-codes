# ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ NCC Telcos Harmonized Codes
List of NCC Harmonized Short Codes For All Mobile Networks In Nigeria

All mobile network operators in Nigeria have been assigned harmonized short codes by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for their subscribers' use. [Source [Punch](https://punchng.com/ncc-directs-telcos-to-implement-harmonised-short-codes/)]  These short codes offer a convenient and fast means for subscribers to access various services like recharging airtime, checking account balances, and subscribing to data plans across all networks.

This was introduced to ensure subscribers can easily memorize a single code to access different services, regardless of the network they are on.
